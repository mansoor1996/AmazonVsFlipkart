    The only reason why I bought this was because it was on sale for 50 bucks
  
",Reviewed in India on 7 October 2017,"









  
  
    
  Let's see what I could have spend my bad investment of 50 bucks on that could have had a much better impact on me and India as a whole-1. 50 Parle-Gs. For my man Snoop Dogg2. 50 mini satchels of fair and handsome cream to help me land that coveted job i had been vying for.3. Two bottles of thumbs up to taste the thunder of adventure and grit.4. 50 pulse candies to OD myself on sugary kindness6. Writing generic ""xyz loves abc "" on the money with emoticons and throwing it on the road.2 Stars because I admire the hustle of CB to low ball every competition out.

  . Making India Awesome is an exceptional manual that gives the nation a chance to come together and make our country irrefutably awesome.If you’ve grazed the cover longingly at the bookstore then you’ve made it into the top 4% of the country. That’s right, if you have shown any interest in this book, you can proudly say you are the lucky few to be a “caring objective Indian”.If you aren’t reading this then you might belong to the 16% of Indians who are “caring but aligned”. But if you haven’t even made it that far, then ugh, you are among the not-so-elite 80% “self-focused indifferent Indians”. Look around you to check.Chetan Bhagat – creator of these labels and discoverer of these well-researched statistics – has illustrated this national breakup with an infographic in case those numbers were confusing.

  He is a good storyteller but has been left no more than a celebrity fever, who wants to be along with them all the times. Now the result is such that he is left with no more than his own written columns to publish as the book. Not a bad idea to make lakhs of bucks huh! Don't know about India but your home will definitely be awesome brother!

  The book is compilation of CB's views on recent happenings in India. The author has given some idea on how to think for the formative conservative mind of today's youth. The book is not for the mature read. Very light book, causal read would do. DON'T EXPECT PROFOUND content.

    An okay-ish attempt but written with pure intention
  
",Reviewed in India on 23 August 2015,"









  
  
    
  Let 1000 better writers than Chetan Bhagat get released and published in India but whenever the book by the Superstar himself releases, the pre-booking breaks all the records. I can never resist buying his book as soon as the pre-order is opened for all the readers. Chetan Bhagat's 8th book overall and categorically, 2nd non-fictional book released 2 days back named ""Making India Awesome"". Chetan Bhagat never does a big launch and marketing tactics for his non-fictional books. He somewhere believes that people concerned with the growth of nation and having love for the country will definitely purchase a book based upon the idea of how to make it the Superpower. But without any fanfare too, the fans like me get to know about his book release.  ""Making India Awesome"" is Chetan Bhagat's attempt of sharing essays and columns he have written on nation time to time and explaining the complex issues in the easiest language possible. It is definitely in the lines of his first non-fictional book, ""What Young India Wants?"" but here, he is not that biased  towards parties the way he was in the former. Still, his love for Narendra Modi and BJP was evident in few sentences. The intention of the book can be clearly understood right from the first chapter itself. Chetan wants the nation to improve and therefore, he discusses ideas on many issues about how they can be resolved with whatever more or less knowledge he had regarding the same.  He have divided the book in four different parts- Awesome Governance, Awesome Equality, Awesome Society and Awesome Resources. Accordingly, he have discussed points like politics, economy, societal values, women's right, gay rights, minority rights and the transformation youth can bring to the nation. This 176-pages book is a light-read and you will find an urge of having an opinion on all the issues after you will end up reading the book. You will want to have an angle in your life for the nation too rather than only blaming the government, ministers and the whole system.  But there's a big problem with the ideas and solutions Chetan Bhagat have provided. The most of them are meant for the government and Prime Minister. The book is mainly like an open letter to Narendra Modi than to the youths of India. The book has been projected as if it's written for us on how to bring glory to the nation at personal level but it's more about how government can improve various things. He have discussed points on how even we can bring the change but even those points aren't much effective except few which are literally possible. I wish if Chetan Bhagat could have been little more sensible in putting up the solutions as some of them are really very silly to even think. I would give this pure effort 3.5* out of 5. Go For It! Thanks. ABHILASH RUHELA - VEERU!!!

    Gives a general perception of India
  
",Reviewed in India on 5 October 2015,"









  
  
    
  When I read the first few chapters of this book, I thought he is going to talk about politics all throughout. However, I was proved wrong. In fact, he covers a diverse set of topics ranging from politics to economy, from welfare to youth and beyond. Bhagat provides few examples where Indians have displayed lackluster character and imposing attitude. He cites few news-makers as a leverage to investigate the problems that society is facing, while suggesting policy makers and masses how to bring in changes in order to ""make India awesome"". Readers may have a different view, but, as someone who lived overseas for many years, I bought this book because I want to know more about India.

  It's cheap. Got it for 48/- bucks. Yeah the quality of this is good. I can say. Slightly yellow pages and no plastic wrapping which means it has been to many customers or they just do not care about the wrapping. The main turnoff - I didn't get any bookmarks.""We are the readers"" remember? Then where is the bookmark?At least flipkart gives me bookmarks.The main problem with these big e-retailers are - their retailers. You order original product and they just show you one or two photos of that product and when you receive that product....it's not original coz the retailer is not 100% genuine.

  Good book, but by no sense awesome. Chetan Bhagat writes in this book in a manner as if he is speaking on a public platform/ forum , but then that has always been his style.The book is essential for Group discussions and for those candidates who have mentioned ""Current Affairs"" as a hobby.It does give you a better view of some of the issues you find in India and the tone used by the author is clear, cool and more mature than the generally unaware Indian.Read it, you may not love it, but you may like it surely.

  Beautiful language... easy to understand.  His observations and foresight are quiet amazing, though I cannot agree with some of his views about the way forward and backward hindus' perspective towards political parties and politicians as well.  I liked most his categorisation of people on the basis of their enthusiasm towards day-to-day political and social developments taking place in our country.  Overall a must-read book.

  Excellent book covering key issues of modern India with lots good suggestions. The book may be a collection of essays published by the author in ToI. But that what makes the book so great. If you care about India or criticizing India and its politics, it is a must read. I have been visiting India for the past 5 years for volunteer service; I can relate to each and every issue Chetan Bhagat has covered so nicely. Very inspiring book for action oriented global citizens. It is an easy read with a no nonsense approach. I will be giving this book to many people as a gift.

  This book contains some good points and i hope our politicians read it too. Some of the ideas put forward by the author are truly good ones that can make a significant impact. However, there are a couple of things I could not completely agree. But again, this is from the authors perspective and it is for the reader to accept or reject the thoughts.

  I must confess that I started reading this book with a preconceived notion about it being written by not a wise or a role-model author.I wasn't sure if my experience would be a good one but it turned out to be one of the best.For the first 50-60 pages, I could easily contradict his views but soon after he started talking about vote bank, politics, economy, minority and women issues, I realized that he actually is speaking his mind and all of it is not as bad as I thought.He said all the things that needed to be said but was not being said by anyone influential.I am glad someone did.

  Due to lack of time I have not read this book yet though it has been 1 week that I got this. However, I know this must be a good one, as always by Chetan. He is my favorite author and I like his every books and article, means, I like whatever he writes. His words are polished and understandable unlike other authors who uses high level language which we rural readers can't understand. What is the use of reading that piece of s*** which we can't get in our mind, right? Sorry, I should not called their writing 'a piece of s***'. They are much intellectual than me. Anyway, can't wait to start my reading session with 'Making India Awesome'. Love u Chetan! Love u Amazon!

  Great book.Topics :Fighting corruption is not restricted to naming and shaming a few corrupt officials. If we think it is okay to cheat in exams, lie to a ticket collector in the train about our kids’ ages and pay a bit of money to avoid a big traffic fine, then at some level we clearly don’t care about eliminating corruption all that much. At best, we hate the politician who gets to steal (while we don’t).The average Indian anywhere in the country is looking for a better quality of life, a certain amount of hope and security and the freedom to make personal choices. The issues that really matter to us are the same. Differences exist, but they don’t run as deep as our politicians would have us believe….This similarity of aspirations, at a fundamental level, is what gives me hopeIf we really want them to ‘Make in India’, the government has to let go. Keep business rules, but align them with international standards. Get the government out of business….The current finance minister may be investor-friendly. The next one may not. If I have invested money in India, how can I be sure the new guy won’t come after me with a stick?Quite frankly, we have some way to go in achieving awesome levels. We still have Section 377, a legacy of the Victorian age, which criminalizes gay sex, a law so regressive, only a few orthodox religious states around the world have it today. We still don’t treat our women right, and often deny them rights without even realizing it. And every now and then, the fear of communalism and actual violence against religious minorities makes them feel unsafe.But mot of the things are like copy pasted from political magazines or news papers

He criticises everybody without taking sides.Every patriotic Indian should read & introspect......

  Many idiots are posting a bad reveiw for the book as Chetan Bhagat has judged a dance show. Dont consider those reveiws. Every celeibrety needs publicity, and so Chetan. Many are posting that Chetan has written this book without any good qualification in politics. Does that matter? Even our prime minister doesn't have any educational qualification and he is leading our country. All that matters is experiance, perception and value that you put for our country that leads our country forward. Content in this book is great. Only one cons. I can find is that for some of the topics or acts, Chetan have only written the negetive part, Ignoring the possitive part. A must read book for every Indian.

  Good thought by Chetan Bhagat. The author's idea behind this book is to make the educated young Indians to think out of the box. Most of us used to support some political party because of some  strange reason. Instead, we have to support any political party based on the current scenario. I suggest all the Chetan Bhagat followers to read this book. It has different dimension from his previous books.

  I liked this book in particular by Chetan Bhagat even though I'm not a big fan of his writing. The issues addressed are relatable and relevant. There is a need that we talked about them. The language is easy and can be understood by all. The content is a bit youth oriented. Delivered within a day by Amazon in prime condition.

  After reading every essay, I would pause, I would put my kindle away and think.  Each of the essays is powerful and would make any serious reader sit and think about the problem.  To me that is an achievement for the author.  You cannot,  in fact,  need not give solutions to all the problems.  If you can make people think seriously about the problem you have won half of the battle.  Once the problem and a need for a solution is acknowledged, the quest for the solutions would begin.  Once the young men and women of the country start thinking for the solutions there would be debates and discussions and solutions will start coming in.As I said in one of my previous reviews, I am happy that some one like Chetan Bhagat is speaking  about issues of this sort.  People will read authors like him, once they read they too would start thinking about these issues and then the probability that these will be resolved goes up.Do read the book. It would definitely make you think about the problems of the nation.

  Cheetan Bhagat's non fiction book dwelles  on contemporary issues. The reader is made aware of social, cultural and political biases found in the Indian psyche. The book can be called success if it could make a few people think on the possible positive alternatives to the present day problems.on the whole it makes an interesting reading

  Let me confess. I am a CB fan since 'Five point something ' days and enjoyed each of his work. 'Making India Awesome ' makes a very good start. In fact almost first half is excellent. But later on, he relies on his previous speeches and articles and those great a distinct disconnect. But overall a good read ...rather a must reader for all young and not so young populace of India.

  You will be wondered about the ideas put forwarded by Chetan Bhagat. He proved that he is not only a fictional writer, but a thinker too. As we know her books always preferred to show some practical approaches to life.  This book obviously a sincere mske resulted by his thoughts.  He always adapted a practical approach all over this book. He never try to blame and insult anyone. Clarifying some day to day problems in our country, and suggests some practical solutions. It might not be a great book but surely have some great intentions. Intentions to make our country, India a better place to live.

  Author seems to be repeating the same points in every other chapter. If you think ""logically"", this book is not for you. Preface is well written but in chapter 2 and 4 author does let you down eventually you stop reading the book.

    Chetan Bhagat's attempt (again) to write non-fiction
  
",Reviewed in India on 20 August 2015,"









  
  
    
  After reading this non-fiction book from a famous fiction writer, I really feel that justice was not done to the topic covered. While the author has clearly clustered the solutions to pain points of India, his lack of depth on the topic is clearly observable. Read it for fun (which the topic doesn't demand). Serious readers can give this a skip.

  I got this book @ Rs. 39 and its still a waste of money. If u want to know about India and its issues, chetan bhagat is not the person to ask. This book just a compilation of some lazily written essays with little research on the roots. The author is not qualified to advice our PM about how to behave with other country's leaders.

",Reviewed in India on 23 August 2015,"









  
  
    
  Great book. Good ideas. This is one of the few good Chetan Bhagat books. Much better than his Half Girlfriend.Most people who have not liked the book are not verified purchasers. Don't go by those reviews.It is a meaningful easy read. He is not taking any one particular political approach and that is a very good thing in this polarized environment of the country. Very appropriate for today's times when politicians are not letting government function and who suffers is the common people.The book is a good mixture of fresh ideas and some very common ideas that have been around for decades.Hopefully people will read this book and start thinking about ""Making India Awesome"".Great initiave from Chetan Bhagat and Amazon.

  It appears that Mr. Bhagat thinks he is the voice of the youth while writing What young India wants. And in this book possibly he wants to be the genius who has solutions for problems of India that not even well learned people can solve. Mr. Bhagat would do well to stick to fiction for the intellectually impoverished. And remember the old story of the Emperors new clothes. No one here is fooled.

  This is as low as any book can fall . .  and as bad as one's writing can get. . .  this is the worst.it cannot get any more bad.  Fills me with utter disgust, just To think of this book of junk even momentarily , for the sake of writing this review.Don't buy it even for free. Let your dog tear it to pieces and use it for a bonfire .

  Don't know about other readers views. But i really loved it. Some essays were already read by me in newspapers. But many are new. Author's has genuine and original solution to the burning problems India's facing. Must read for all those who wanna give a tonic to their brain and care for their country. Sometimes English is though but it's ok being it an essay and not a noble.

  I haven't read the book , so I can't say anything about it. It was a rakhi gift for my sis. She is happy and give me a good review about the book. I read the descriptions and critical reviews about this book and depending on all of the above I rate this book a 4star.sadly, this time amazon failed to maintain a good delivery service. I had to receive the book on 29 August,Rakhi , but I receive it on 4th September. Amazon and Bluedart courier service both were responsible for that kind of harassment. But, now my sis is happy, so I'm happy too...Lastly, I'm a huge fan of Chetan Bhagat's fiction stories. So, I expect much more from his next book....

  First, Chetan Bhagat is the only person in India who has the gutts to speak what he feels like about a scenario, let that be fair or not! He analyses every points and contrasts them with very strong explanations.Second, he uses simpler language. This helps readers to easily understand what he feels.Third, this guy has the potential to write about recent problems in India! And this book is a clear reflection of this!So, without any hesitation,go for this book! Opinions will always vary in terms of problems in India! CB portrayed his opinions and if not we agree, we should at least appreciate his work!

  Most readers who criticise Chetan Bhagat are just an example of why India is still a developing country because we dont appreciate people who rise from humble backgrounds and go on to become succussful unlike those born with silver spoon. People ridicule him for the fact that he being from IIT IIM and then after working in an MNC invstement bank decided to leave his job and start writing that too in simple English and strike a chord with the middle class indian youth. Just appreciate that he is concerned about the issues faced by our country and asking us to become inclusive in the development process.

  It's the usual Chetan Bhagat trash. I wonder when people will realise that he is no intellectual but a poseur who has made it big by writing dumb rubbish for a generation which knows nothing of what good writing or literature is all about.

  Well, I would say this was the kind i would love reading. He has written columns on every sensational issues following in the country.Somewhere these thoughts do come to our mind but we just overshadow with our day-to-day thoughts. It was good because he has touched on each and every sensational topics, hasnt cribbed about those but has provided with possible solutions.

  I hope there could be a 1/4th star. I guess mr bhagat should write only movie stories now. Coming over to book:- our intelligent author thinks that everything than he says the young indian will blindly follow. Some of the aspects of the books goes beyond reality but then averagely some topics are nicely written.Majorly the rise if BJP SARKAAR is included in this book thats what i think.Or the election period and india should be the tittle

",Reviewed in India on 20 August 2015,"









  
  
    
  One of the reasons why Chetan Bhagat is popular with readers around the country is that he has mastered the art of creating simple, yet effective communication, whether it is through hos fiction or non-fiction, which strikes a chord with the audience. Making India Awesome is another such book, which touches on complicated topics in a smart and effective manner.

  It should come with a statutory warning saying: ""This book can lower your IQ by just looking at it!

That'll be one easy way of making India awesome!PS: Isn't preorder supposed to be cheaper? Preorder was for 125/ and now it's for 75/. LOL. Download a PDF if you are dead set on turning you brain into mush, don't pay this guy for his useless, plagiarised ideas that put the word "" idea"" to shame.

",Reviewed in India on 12 September 2015,"









  
  
    
  Every Indian must read this book!! The author has identified the major issues in our country and the reasons why we are facing them. He has pick up the examples which are unfortunately the fact about us.You may not agree to all the suggestions and solutions he has given for the problems however, there is a scope to work towards them.I urge the fellow citizens to spare sometime to read this book because our country is our responsibility and no body else's. If we continue to live this miserable life which only focuses on our personal interests and continue to believe that we have come into this world only to settle down with a decent job and a small family, then we are only contributing to make our life more and more miserable. The coming generations will only have money but not the products on which they can their spend money as we are not realising the need of supporting our farmers and taking care of our natural resources. We all want to work in corporate which makes you and your spouse work for 12 hours in an air conditioned office, typing on the computer and leave you with no time to talk to your children and other family members. Its high time we pause and see where we are heading. Mind it people! you are not even being selfish in the true sense. So start being selfish and make your country a place which has advantages for you!

  The title of the review is one I doubt Mr.Bhagat will be able to pronounce at one go. I suppose contemplating any words longer than two syllables will make Mr. Bhagat's brain explode in superb technicolor.Calling this a 'book of ideas' or 'essays' is a bit of a stretch, since the essays read like they were written for a fourth (okay, I'll be generous - fifth) grade writing competition. But far be it for me to say that Mr. Bhagat is not an expert on anything. He is an expert on the non-sequitur and the strawman argument. For example, in one chapter he says that ""until we see graft and tax evasion as a problem, and start to truly care about them, politicians will not change."" Indeed, Mr. Bhagat, it is only a Bollywood-style emotional epiphany that is missing for us Indians to solve the problem of corruption! We just need to ""care more""! The problems are not really structural, a result of complex regulation and the lack of simple legal and identity requirements in business transactions! The fact is, we just don't have the right ""feelings"" about this whole corruption business!And on and on. The book was a gift, and I can't wholly complain that it was a useless one. On days I felt bad about myself, this book served as an amazing pick-me-up. Why, I thought, leafing through the pages, here is an idiot who is willing to advertise the fact in print. I always closed it all cheered up.

  This books put together some regular thoughts on Indian society and politics. The first chapter probably motivated me to read it but as I moved forward in the book, it became a usual trite. If an average 23 year old is asked to write an essay on Indian politics and society, he would write this book. It doesn't come up with any concrete policy or structural changes. It narrates the usual picture of our country. This might be helpful for some one not known to India and who wants to know what's up with this country.I was pretty disappointed with this book.

  Making India awesome. Ok, how? All typical and known formula like change your attitude, develop discipline, concentrate on your individual contribution and attempts to clarify some social issues. Then, are they convincing and influential?  Well, not much.This book is like those movies or a talk shows which identify problems, although not perfectly and show you ways of correcting or solving them, but unfortunately it is not able to put deep impression on your mind and will get erased from your psyche within few days.This kind of book needs the author get connected to the readers through powerful conceptual writing that strike the mind and the soul of the readers. The book fails to do that. The book lacks influential power. No topic is discussed in depth with full potential. Gender equality, you need to talk in details about stress on women working from 8 to 6 and its effect on individual family and combined effect on social condition of the nation. Also its adverse effect on health (read hormones) and child development who are future of the nation.There are many other topic which need to be detailed, for example, involvement of educated people in traditional agriculture which is backbone of the country, survival and improvement of the rural life, adverse effects of newer technologies, maintenance of environment.

",Reviewed in India on 20 August 2015,"









  
  
    
  A utterly stupid person acting like a critic and giving his remarks on india.. it nothing but a compilation of a his articles.. he ha insulted a lot of things kn india for no particular reason.. mainly the way he has insuted Narendra Modi and not anyone from Congress or AAP or other politicle parties shows he is biased. he has spoken outrageous things about Modi. being a citizen of India we must respect our PM. and not make joles about him working 24X7. you're right CB had made jokes on Modi not taking any holiday.. an much more.. he is just a love stoy writer and he must have stayed like that he is no leader. He is merely Rahul Gandhi of authours. The title o this book should have been Thrashing India..

Personally i believe that what young india wants was good read but i dont know that why chetan write this one. Not a single page is worth read. I actually dont understand that what he is actually trying to say in the whole book. After writing 7 novels and 10 years of experience , chetan write this non-sense is unbelievable. Now after my friend hearing this horrible review by me and other purchaser who post on amazon , He is planning to give this book to gau maata so atleast some one can enjoy this book. Dont waste your 125 bucks on this disaster. Thank you.  :-)

I know Preity is very pretty & you can't let your eyes off her but why the damm you don't do the job of writing? Your books were among the best-seller books in India.

  My friend gave me this book as a gift. One of the best gifts ever. Excellent book covering key issues of modern India with lots good suggestions. The book may be a collection of essays published by the author in ToI. But that what makes the book so great. If you care about India or criticizing India and its politics, it is a must read. I have been visiting India for the past 5 years for volunteer service; I can relate to each and every issue Chetan Bhagat  has covered so nicely. Very inspiring book for action oriented global citizens. It is an easy read with a no nonsense approach. I will be giving this book to many people as a gift.
